        <h2>Kuldeep Jhinjer</h2>
        <p>From the moment I started thinking about hacking video games, I know I was hooked on the world of Computer Science. I started with C++  to write down simple game hacking scripts, then I moved on to python and javascript. To explore more, I have read through as much material as one can go through and I have also enrolled in a Web design and Development course. I have truly discovered my passion in life.
